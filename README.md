# The Neon Shadows - Diploma Project in Unreal Engine 5

## About the project
### Core Idea
The following project inspired by the game Ghostrunner is a mix of parkour and precise Katana combat allowing players to quicly kill their opponents while using the enviroment to their advantage. With the one-hit-one-kill mechanic players can feel unstoppable, while still thinking ahead to make perform the most approprite combo to survive each encounter. If they fail, once per level, they can rewind the time to take a step back and return to action without needing to respawn.
So slide, run and slice until nothing is left alive and compare your score with your friends on leaderboards thanks to Steam Integration and Epic Leaderboard.
